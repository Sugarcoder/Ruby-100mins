# There are 2 ways of collecting data in Ruby: Arrays and Hashes.


# Array = a number-indexed list.  An array starts with [0....]

# Index = The address of a specific element inside the array. The addresses are in a specific order.

# The index always starts with 0. 


# Example: 

meals = ["breakfast", "lunch", "dinner"]
puts meals[2]
puts meals.first
puts meals.last

meals << "dessert"        # Adds "dessert" to the end of the string

puts meals[3]
puts meals             # Answer is "breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert".






# SORT = You can rearrange an array by using the "sort" method. 


# EACH = You can iterate through each element by using the "each" method. 


# JOIN = You can mash arrays together using the "join" method.


# INDEX = You can find a specific element by using the "index" method. 


# INCLUDE = You can ask the array if an element is present by using the "include?" method.



# EXAMPLE (adding to class PersonalChef): 

def gameplan(meals)
  meals.each do |meal|
    puts "We'll have a #{meal}..."
  end
  
  all_meals = meals.join(", ")
  puts "In summary: #{all_meals}
end
