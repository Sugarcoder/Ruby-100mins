day_of_year = Date.today.yday
puts "Happy " + today + "! It is the " + day_of_year.to_s + "of the year." 

# to_s = Method to convert a number into a string






# ANOTHING METHOD OF COMBING NUMBERS WITH STRINGS IS CALLED: 
# "STRING INTERPOLATION" 

# String Interpolation #{} = Sticking data into the middle of a string 

# Example: 

puts "Happy #{today}! It is the #{day_of_year} day of the year." 






# PUTTING CODES INTO THE INTERPOLATION

# Example:

modifier = "very" 
mood = "excited"
puts "I am #{modifier * 3 + mood} today!"
