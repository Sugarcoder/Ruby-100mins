# Return value is like a sous chef. 
# You ask the sous chef to make something, they make it and then return back to you for more instructions. 

# Example: 

class PersonalChef
  def mix_eggs(scrambled)
    puts "mix the #{scrambled} eggs please." 
    return self
  end

  
  def add_milk(quantity)
    puts "add #{quantity} of milk into the eggs and then mix it."
    return self
  end
  
end 

SugarCoder = PersonalChef.new



# Calling one method after another is called "method chaining".


# You can call multiple methods at once (ex. object.method1.method2.method3



# Example: 

SugarCoder.mix_eggs("scrambled").add_milk("1 Tablespoon")
