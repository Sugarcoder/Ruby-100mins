# There are 2 basic kind of numbers: 
# integers (whole numbers) and floats (have a decimal point).
# Integers are easier to work with compared to floats (avoid if possible)




# ITERATING 


# "for" loop is popular to use to repeat something.

# Example: 

for(int i=0; i < 5; i++)
  {
    printf "Goodnight, Moon" 
  }
  

# However, in Ruby, we use "times"



# Example: 

def make_eggs(quantity)
  quantity.times do      
    puts "Making an egg"
  end
    puts "I am done!"
    return self
end
   


 # When we call "times", we need to tell it how many times to "do" something.
