# Hashes = A collection of data where each element of data is addressed by a name.

# Hash = An unordered collection where the data is ordered into keys or value pairs. 



# Example (Analogy): 

# Like a refridgerator - We don't care where the item is in the fridge. However, things are assigned names. 
# Apples = 1, Oranges = 2, Bananas = 3


# Example: 

produce = {"apples" => 3, "oranges" => 6, "eggs" => 12}
puts "There are #{produce['eggs']} eggs in the fridge."


produce["grapes"] = 100           # This will add grapes to the end of the list. 




# When creating a hash, the keys and values are linked by the => (known as the rocket symbol).

# Hashes start with { bracket and end with } bracket.




# Simple way to code Hash:


produce = {apples: 3, oranges: 6, eggs: 12}
puts "There are #{produce[:oranges]} oranges in the fridge."



# Counting Inventory using Hashes

# Adding this onto "class PersonalChef":


def inventory
  produce = {apples: 3, oranges: 6, eggs: 12}
  produce.each do |item, quantity|
    puts "There are #{quantity} #{item} in the fridge."
  end
end


SugarCoder.inventory                # You can see the whole list here.
