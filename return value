# Return value is like a sous chef. 
# You ask the sous chef to make something, they make it and then return back to you for more instructions. 

# Example: 

class PersonalChef
  def mix_eggs
    puts "mix the eggs please." 
    return self
  end

  
  def add_milk
    puts "add some milk into the eggs please."
    return self
  end
  
end 


# Calling one method after another is called "method chaining".


# You can call multiple methods at once (ex. object.method1.method2.method3
